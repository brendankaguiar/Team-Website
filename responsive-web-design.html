		<h1>Responsive Web Design</h1>

		<h2>What is Responsive Web Design</h2>
		<p>Responsive web design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge, a website, to make it appealing and viable on all devices.</p>

		<h2>Use of Responsive Web Design</h2>
		<p>Responsive Web Design is used for automatically resizing the website based on the screen size, platform, and orientation that is being used to view the website.</p>
		<p>Through the use of responsive web design, the website is adjusted to fit the viewport. As shown in the image down below, the difference between a viewport with responsive web design and one without is obvious. The non-responsive site is customized for desktop use only, while the responsive site is much easier to use, as it is fitted for mobile device use.</p>
		<div class="image">

	  </div>

		<p>Responsive web design adjusts the entire website, from images, texts, frame, etc.</p>
		<p>Responsive images, otherwise known as flexible images, can be resized proportionally to best fit the current screen size.</p>
		<p>Media queries are used to set changes when the screen size is a specific px size, including portrait, landscape orientations. The use of media query allows for multiple style sheets for basic layout alterations.</p>
		<p>Showing or hiding content depending on the screen size of the website to best fit. For mobile browsing, content is removed to fit with the screen size, and the larger the screen size is, the more space a site can display.</p>

		<h2>Why Use Responsive Web Design</h2>

		<p>The importance of using Responsive Web Design stems from the growing use of smartphones, and other such devices to browse through the internet.</p>
		<p>In 2014, only 22% turned to their phone first to browse the internet, and by the end of 2016, mobile web browseing had overtaken desktop use. The shift from desktop to mobile use is self evident, as more people begin to use mobile for browsing through the internet, it becomes vastly important for websites to invest in responsive web design to fit with the ever growing use of mobile devices.</p>
		<p>Important reasons for investing in responsive web design is for cost effectiveness, flexibility, improved use experience, search engine optimization gains, and ease of management. For cost effectiveness, the use of a responsive web design eliminates the need to create a seperate site for mobile users as only a single site with responsive web design can be adjusted for any internet browsing device. For flexibility, responsive web design cna be used for making changes quickly and easily. For improved user experience, responsive web design can adjust to any screen size, leaving for a good experience for and user. For search engine optimization gains, Google has, since 2015, been giving preference to website with mobile friendly sites boost in search page rankings. For ease of management, responsive web design is easy and quickly to change and manage.</p>
		<p>Clearly put, Responsive Web Design resizes the entire website, from the images, navigation bar, text, everything about the website. Changing the design from a screen size of a desktop to the screen size of a mobile phone completely changes the amount of space the design of the website can use.</p>
